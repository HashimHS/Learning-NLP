I will use this repository to store what I have learned about Natural Language Processing from the Language Technology course.

# Lab0: Spell Checker
Basically, the goal of the spell checker program is to return a the word that is the most probable correction to $w$ by using a dictionary of known words along with the probability of each word to occur. To create this dictionary the program uses a text file $big.txt$ of about a million word (concatenation of public domain book excerpts).

# Lab1: Indexer
The goal of this lab is to create an index of all the words in a set of documents with the position of each word in the documents. We will call this a master index. Then, we will calculate the tf-idf values for each pair of document-word. Finally, we represent the similarity between each pair of documents.

# Lab2: Language Models
In this lab, we aim to calculate the probability of a sentence using Unigrams, Bigrams and Trigrams. Then we write a program that predicts the next word using the last two words in a sentence.
